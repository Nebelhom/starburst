Starburst
=========

Nope this game is not, in any way, linked to the rather popular sweets that can be bought across the globe, but is my own little pet project and first attempt at writing a game. It is written in the popular scripting language Python (www.python.org) utilising the very easy to use pygame library (www.pygame.org).

The aim is to burst as many shooting stars (you may also call them just circles or balls) as possible by strategically placing explosives around the field in question and detonating them manually. Different shooting stars (yes, I stick to imagination) bring different amounts of points and some special shooting stars may double or half your score at the time of detonation.

The game is not yet finished, but slowly but surely I am getting there. Feel free to check it out at various stages in the game.

NOTE:

If you are interested in how I wrote the game menu, I created a short series of mini tutorials on the game menu that you can follow. I noticed that all the tutorials on writing a game menu were seriously out of date and I did not want to use one out of the box and downloadable at pygame.
